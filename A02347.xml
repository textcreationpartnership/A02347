            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I doe not tell you hovv this ſtaffe, shall keepe you from the danger of your ennemies only, I vvill content my ſelfe in ſpeaking but one vvorde, touching the ſame, (that is to ſay) that you shall not only obtayne and get victory of your ennemies, but alſo ſend them avvay vvith their mouthes ſtopped. Therefore I deſire you in Gods name, that ye be not ſlothfull nor negligent, to ſtudy therein often, and to haue thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:3694:5"/> ſentences therein alledged readily at yovr fingers endes, that thereby the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſte be auaunced, and the dominion of the deuilles and infidels deſtroyed and abolished.</p>
            <p>I doe knovve very vvell that manye people haue accuſtomed to ſaye, vvhen it is ſpoken vnto them of the auncients, ſpeaking vvithout eyther iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or reaſon, in ſaying that as touching the Auncientes, they haue nothing to doe vvith them, for they vvvere men as they: but that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues only vvith the vvorde of God. I vvoulde not altogither denie or gaineſaye them in that, if they vvould not reiect thereby God and his giftes, by thinking to reiect men and their doctrine. Therefore vve ought to take good heede vnto men vvhen they ſpeake of themſelues, and alſo vvhen God ſpeaketh by them. The ſame vve may knovve, vvhen their doctrine is confirmable and agreeing to the rule of all right, vvhich is the vvord of God the doctrine of the prophets &amp; Apoſtles. Furthermore, vve vvould not haue you ignorant, that the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers haue ordayned and eſtablished a great many of ceremonies, and thinges in the churche reſpecting the time and perſonnes, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of thoſe that dayly come vnto the knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpell, aſvvell of Ievves as of panims and Idolaters: But they haue done that onely but for a certaine time, to the ende they might dravve to the Goſpell all nations, and let and ſtoppe the vvay of the Heritickes and ennemies of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke faithe, from gayning and vvinning the vveake in faithe. For vve ought not to maruayle, if the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers haue done many thinges in that time,
<pb facs="tcp:3694:5"/> vvhich novv can not ſerue, nor profite vs any thing at all, inaſmuch as they haue ſerued but onely for their time. For the Apoſtles haue ordayned ſome thinges vvhich novve ought not to be follovved nor kept. As vve doe reade in the actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that the counſell that vvas celebrated by the Apoſtles in Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note> decreed that vve ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from bloude, and from the fleshe of beaſtes that vvere ſtrangled: VVe knovve vvell inough that this ordinance novv hath no more place, and is not in force among the chriſtians,<note place="margin">

Then vvee ſee that that decree, vvhich hath bene decreed by the holy ſpirite &amp; by the Apoſtles, to haue bene made, bicauſe of the perſonnes, and to ſerue onely but for that time.</p>
            <p>Iudge novve, if an ordinance made by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to ſupport the infirmitie of men, hath bene ſet foorth, and aftervvardes abolished: vvhat oughte vve to iudge of thoſe vvhich are of leſſe importance vvhich haue bene ordayned by men, a great deale inferior and of leſſe eſtimation then the Apoſtles? There is no doubt, that foraſmuch as they haue bene ordayned to ſerue onely for that time, that novve vve may let them alone and forſake them, bicauſe that there is neyther Ievves nor Turkes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, but chriſtians, at the leaſt as they ſaye.</p>
            <p>Alſo vve ought not vpon this to holde our peace or hide the vnshameleſſe malice of many, vvho (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe calling themſelues chriſtians) vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of antiquitie, and of the auncient doctors, doe forge and inuent of their ovvne vvicked and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye

And yet the malice is ſo great in them, that all they that vvill not receiue and allovve, that vvhich their brayne hath inuented vnder the name of holy men, they crye after them vvith open mouth, to the fire, to the fire vvith the Heritickes. They reiecte the doctrine of the fathers. Alas O my God and Lord thou knovveſt our hearts: and the heartes of theſe lyers, that vve doe not deſire but that in all and through all, be it through life or death, that thy ſon Ieſus Chriſt, and his doctrine, may be onely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, loued and vvorshipped: And for this are vve apoynted as sheepe to be ſlayne: vve are nought ſet by, mocked, beaten, banished, chaſed from tovvne to tovvne: To be short vve are eſteemed and counted as the moſt vile &amp; ſtinking filthyneſſe of all the vvorld, troden dovvne vnderneth the feete of the vvorldlinges: But for all that vve poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience, looking for the righteous Iudge vvhich vvill iudge all the vvorld, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of men, but according to hys holy vvorde, for vvhich vve are had novve in ſuche abhomination to the vvorlde.</p>
            <p>Furthermore they vvhich dayly accuſe vs vvith ſo greate rage and furye, againſt the auncient doctrine of the Apoſtles and Doctors, shall at the laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge their malice and liuing, that they haue declared in their bookes, corrupting and marring the bookes of the auncient fathers of the churche: If I durſt, I vvould gladly name one vvho in that

The bouckler of the faithe: vvherein he declareth the ſubtiltie of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and craft, alledging the auncient Doctors in Latine, after tranſlating them into Frenche, and at euery place where he found Sacrificium, or the like manner of ſpeaking, in ſteade to put in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or holy myſterie, he hath tranſlated them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes the holy myſterie of the Maſſe, and ſo by that meanes they finde that vvorde Maſſe in the bookes of thoſe good fathers, vvhich they neuer thought nor did. I beleeue he thought that his booke should not come but only in the handes of yong children, or elſe he thought that he had to doe but vvith beaſtes like vnto himſelfe. There is no man though he haue but ſmall iudgement and vnderſtanding, vvhich reading that booke, but that he may ſee at the firſt dashe hovv he lyeth, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayeth and reuoketh it agayne, and neuertheleſſe he is heard and accounted as halfe a God: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the pooreſt ſort, but of the greateſt in the vvorlde. In the meane time vve ought not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle at this, that ſuch gallants haue bene ſo hardy and ouerbolde, foraſmuch as they vvere ſupported and maintayned of Kings, Emperors, Princes, and Magiſtrates, and that they vvere the beſt vvelcome to their Court.</p>
            <p>I remember that I haue reade in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hiſtories, that in the time of the auncient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>22.</hi>
               </note> there vvere abuſers and ſeducers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſovved their peſtilent venim amongſt the doctrine of the auncients: Of that Deniſe bishop
<pb facs="tcp:3694:7"/> of Corinth complayned very much, ſaying, that many haue ſovvn in his Epiſtles much vvicked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Therefore thinke, that if they haue bene ſo hardy and bolde that they durſt corrupt the vvry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of the auncientes, yea vvhileſt they vvere yet aliue. VVhat vvill they doe novve? at the leaſt they vvill doe aſmuch, as their auncient fathers, that is to ſaye thoſe Apoſtates ennemies of the fathers.</p>
            <p>Novv notvvithſtanding their shameleſſe malyce they rebuke and checke vs vvith a vvhores face, that vve are ennemies of the fathers, deſpiſers and contemners of their doctrine, and diſturbers of the vvorld. I vvould to God that they vvould permitte and ſuffer vs to compare our doctrine openly, and before all the vvorld vvith theirs, to the end that all men might knovve vvho be the contemners and ennemies of the fathers: ſomuch it vvantith that vve should be found condemners and ennemies of thoſe good fathers, that altogither it vvoulde be ſeene that the ſame doctrine that vve hold &amp; keepe at this day, is the very ſame for vvhiche manye of thoſe good fathers haue shead their bloud: and vvould shead it, if they vvere novve aliue.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth that the ſame is not true that I haue ſpoken, that if the fathers vvere yet aliue, that men vvould put them cruelly to death, as moſt vvicked Heritickes. Yea they vvhich at this daye doe boſte and brag them ſelues to be their obedient children, and make bucklers of their bookes.</p>
            <p>Vnderſtand and hold faſt in minde (dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) behold this preſent booke may ſerue vs for a certayne argument, of that vvhich is compoſed and faithfully gathered togither, out of the very bookes
<pb facs="tcp:3694:7"/> of the auncient Doctors: That if I vvould preſent this preſent booke (vvherein there is nothing in it of mine, but altogither of the auncientes) for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my faith to thoſe enemies of the fathers, I doubt not but preſently I should be as a moſte vvicked Heretick, condemned to be burned quicke into ashes. Novve ſee (dearely beloued) and iudge iuſtly before God according to your ovvn conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, vvhether vve be the ennmies of the fathers or they.</p>
            <p>The auncient fathers haue ſayde that the breade of the ſupper abideth alvvayes breade, not being tranſubſtantiated or chaunged: I doe demaund of you in good faith, vvherefore or vvhat is the cauſe that they shead dayly ſo abundantly the bloude of the poore children of God? Is it not vpon this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poynte, or for this cauſe, that the fathers haue beleeued and mayntayned vvith a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as you shall ſee in that booke vpon the arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Lordes ſupper? I leaue it to your ovvne iudgement. Furthermore vve doe reade that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, of vvhom theſe here doe aduance, and boſt them ſelues to keepe and mayntayne their doctrine, haue broken in peeces the images of Ieſus Chriſte, and of the Saintes, that haue bene ſet vp in the temple of the chriſtians, ſaying that it is againſt the Chriſtian doctrine to haue Images in the Church.</p>
            <p>VVhat is he that doubteth, that if the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vvere yet liuing, and that they shoulde ſo breake the Images as they did in that time, but that they shoulde be out of hande, or vvith all ſpeede condemned as heretickes to be burned, yea if they
<pb facs="tcp:3694:8"/> eſcaped ſo. For vve do ſee many dayly vvhich doe not eſcape ſo good cheape, but they haue done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all the torments and paynes that theſe vvorshippers of the fathers can inuent or imagin.</p>
            <p>Then vvhen you shall reade the doctrine of the fathers contayned in this preſent booke, iudge vvhether it may be confeſſed and maintayned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly before theſe vvorshippers of the fathers vvithout daunger of lyfe. In the meane time, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you (my deare brethren) that ye feare not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon your bodie and lyfe, for a doctrine ſo iuſt, holy, and good: and let vs reioyce in this, that vve holde the true auncient doctrine of the Prophets, Apoſtles and Doctors of the Church.</p>
            <p>And as touching you, O ye Princes, Iudges, and Magiſtrates, betvveene vvhoſe handes this preſent booke shall happen to fall: I deſire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, in the name of the liuing God, and of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde vvhich hath shed out all his bloud vpon the croſſe for the loue of vs, that you doe giue right iudgement vpon the poore faithfull people, of vvhome your priſons are at this time full, through the furor and madneſſe of thoſe vvorshippers of the fathers, and bee no more the hangmen of that vvicked Vermine: for it is not counted a thing honeſt nor meete among men, that the Kings, Emperours, Princes, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates shoulde bee made the hangmen of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Sapi.</hi> 6.</note>Be ye then more ashamed than euer you vvere, bicauſe that you beare the name of God, and the povver to gouerne the people is giuen you from God, not for to abuſe it in punishing the good, and
<pb facs="tcp:3694:8"/> defending the vvicked, but to maintayne and ayde the good, and to punish the vvicked (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue taught vs.) But alas my God, into vvhat blindeneſſe is the vvorlde fallen into, to eſteeme and thinke that they vvhich holde and keepe the true auncient doctrine are heretikes.</p>
            <p>O you Iudges and Magiſtrates, doe you not ſee dayly in your priſons, the poore children of God, to eate and drinke very ſcarſly bread and vvater, and to be caſt moſt vilely and filthily into a lovve dunge on vvith the venimous beaſtes, lying as the poore beaſtes vpon a little ſtravve hauing their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and legges broken vvith the racke?</p>
            <p>Doe you not ſee (I ſay) on the other ſide thoſe goodly maſters vvhich beare ſuch great zeale to the auncient fathers, to haue their bellye altogither ſtuffed vvith vvine and delicate fare, coming forth from their bankets and feaſtes vvith a face as red as fire, or like to a Butchers boule, comming forth to paſſe avvaye the time, for to examine the poore faythfull people, vvhich are not ſought for at the table vvhere good cheare is, but in a moſt filthie and darke dungeon: they are poore children of God tyed and bounde vvith chaynes, vvith a pale face and thinne cheekes, brought before thoſe fat bellies and firie faces through their ouermuche drinking and quaffing of vvine, and the firſt vvords they ſpeake is, come hither thou vvicked here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, avvay thou da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned ſeducer of the people, thou haſt the deuil vvithin thee. And aſſone as the pore children of God did thinke to haue ſpoken for their defence, the fatte bellies quicklye put their hands to their Bible, but it is another Bible than the olde
<pb facs="tcp:3694:9"/> olde or nevve teſtament: For they can do nothing but prouide faggots, and crie to the fire, to the fire vvith thoſe vvicked heretickes, I knovve not vvhere they haue learned to doe ſo. Haue they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that of the Prophetes and Apoſtles? It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no. Neyther haue they learned it of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers. For they shall finde vvithin this preſent booke, that they haue ſpoken and done altogither othervviſe: therefore they declare that it is a rage and a madneſſe that they haue conceyued againſt the truth for to extinguishe and abolishe it vtterly, and all thoſe that maintaine it: For libertie to ſpeake is taken from vs. Thoſe that vvould ſpeake, their tongues are cut out of their heades? and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvardes are burned.</p>
            <p>In the meane time O ye Iudges and Magiſtrates, vvhich haue the publicke charge, haue regard from henceforth vvhat you doe in condemning them to death. You cannot condemne them to death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye condemne all the good and auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to death vvith them. VVhat order doe you call this to condemne to death as Heretickes the Saintes and their doctrine, vnto vvhom they crye and dayly pray vnto in their Letanie, ſaying, O Sancte Auguſtine, O Sancte Cypriane, O Sancte Hieronime. &amp;c. Ora pro nobis, that is to ſay, O Saint Auguſtine, O Saint Cyprian, O Saint Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, and ſo conſequently of the other, pray for vs. And in the meane time they condemne them, and their vvritinges, and all thoſe that follovve theyr doctrine to be burned, as the experience dothe dayly teach vs.</p>
            <p>Therefore ye that Iudge the people haue a good
<pb facs="tcp:3694:9"/> reſpect vnto that that you haue to doe: for it is not onely vnto vs that you doe adreſſe your ſelues, but alſo to the ſonne of God, vvhich hath ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple or ſight of mine eye. The ſame hath bene vvell shevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Paule, VVhen he perſecuted the poore fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, crying from heauen after him,<note place="margin">

            <p>Euen ſo (my deare brethren) vve shall reſt in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and shall not be ashamed to be condemned vvith all thoſe good and auncient fathers of the church, and not onely vvith them, but alſo vvith all the Prophets and Apoſtles.

Be ye ioyfull and reioyce to be enrovvled in their bande, for to beare vvith them, the yoke of Ieſus Chriſt? perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere valiantly in the doctrine that you haue already receiued, for no man can hurt you. Ought vve not greatly to reioyce of this, that the perſecuting ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes can doe our bodyes no more hurt, then a vvolfe or theefe of the vvoods, vvhich can but murther or kill vs. Let vs reioyce, for our names are vvritten in heauen. VVe haue yet this good turne (thankes be vnto our good God therefore) that the perſecutors can do vnto vs no vvorſe then to to put and place vs vvith our good God in the

            <p>VVhat is he that vvould not deſire to goe playe vvith ſo happy a company eternally and vvithout ende?<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> Yea to be in glory vvhich the eye hath not ſeene, and eare hath not heard, neyther hath entred into mans minde, the thinges vvhich God hath prepared to ſuch as loue him.</p>
            <p>Againe, foraſmuch as they eſteeme and court vs ſo vvicked and abhominable, and crye ſo ſpitefully after vs, as after the vvickedeſt people of all the vvorld, to make vs and our doctrine odious vnto the people: They commaund them not to heare or harken vnto vs, they make the ſimple people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, vvhen they haue them vnder confeſſion, that if they doe not accuſe vs, they shall be damned.</p>
            <p>Their craft, ſubtiltye and enuye agaynſte the truth is to be maruayled at. In the meane time I vvould vvillingly that they vvould accord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vvith vs to conferre their doctrine vvith ours, their croſſe and perſecution vvith ours, their lyfe vvith ours, theyr church vvith ours: By that means vve should plainly ſee vvhether they be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God or vve. Firſt of all haue not vve the baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me purely adminiſtred, as vve doe reade that the Apoſtles haue adminiſtred it vvithout any inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, but onely according to the vvord of God? Let one reade the Scriptures, and he shall ſee vvho it is that hath added to the Sacramentes, eyther vve or they.</p>
            <p>Furthermore let men behold the perſecutions that they ſuffer for their doctrine, the number is ſoone counted, for there is not one vvhich hath
<pb facs="tcp:3694:10"/> ſuffred death for their doctrine: neuertheleſſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath promiſed that his church shal haue perſecution in the vvorld, ſaying, ye shall be hated of all men for my name.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.</note> Hovv can they be hated of all men ſith that they be in all places the beſt vvelcome? Hovv commeth it that one shoulde thinke to doe ſacrifice vnto God in putting them to death? I did neuer knovve any.</p>
            <p>I doe accord and agree in this, that they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times taken priſoners, but it is in the good feaſtes and bankettes, and in the beſt ſeates of the table: and vvhereas the children of God are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vvith fire, they here are burned throughe the heate of VVine. Their innocent fleshe is hevven and cut in peeces, but it is at the table vpon their treachers. They are rotten and conſumed vvith the Goute of Naples, inſomuch that they fall in peces.</p>
            <p>They are melted and melted againe many times in a yeere. Beſides all the dangers they put them ſelues into both day and night to runne after other mens vvyues, in great danger of their life. And yet ſome vvill ſay that they are not perſecuted: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that they be, for one shall ſee a great many more among them to dye Martyrs, of the paines that vve did ſpeake of euen novv, then of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſeaſes or ſickneſſes. They are then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, no man can denie, yea, but it is of the diuell: and vvhat is he that doubteth of it?</p>
            <p>And as concerning their life it is knovven vvell inough and manyfeſted vnto all men: Their good vvorkes and godly fruites vvhat it bringeth in all places, deſtroying and corrupting all the vvorlde, aſvvell ſpiritually as corporally. This I am ſure of,
<pb facs="tcp:3694:11"/> that foraſmuch as I haue touched and medled but vvith the doore of their kitchin, they vvill ſay I am a vvicked Hereticke: But vvhat then? Shoulde I hold my peace for their menaces and iniuries? No, no, God forbid, but rather I vvill crye vvith open mouth after them, bicauſe they haue ſo corrupted and deſtroyed the Lordes Vineyard.</p>
            <p>Alas, alas, my God vvhat is he that ought not but to lament and vveepe vvith bloudy teares, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the vvorld to be ſo led into the bottome of hell, ſo many poore ſoules led to perdition. O Lord regard thy poore people, haue ſome pitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them, for vvhom thy ſonne our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath offred to thee his body and bloud in a ſacrifice: and ſuffer not that thy poore sheepe be ſo put as a pray for to be deuoured of al beaſtes.</p>
            <p>For vve are dayly aſſaulted vvith ſo many enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, that ſathan riſeth agaynſt vs, for to make vs forſake and abandon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to renounce his Goſpell: One day vve haue vvarre agaynſt the Heretickes Anabaptiſtes, an other day agaynſt Libertines, Epicures, Arians, Dauidiſtes, and agaynſt diſſemblers, and conſequently, againſt the vvorshippers of the fathers, through vvhoſe zeale the children of God are put to death. Haue not vve then great neede of vveapons? It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth yea, if vve vvould not be taken in their ſnares, as many at this day are, through the iuſt iudgement of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore if there be any time to pray, or to vvatch, it is novve: Let vs then vvatch and praye, to the end vve may auoyde all thoſe dangers, and perſeuer and continevve to the ende.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3694:11"/>
            <p>You haue bene the firſt of your citie (dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued) I alſo doe hope in the Lord you shall not be the laſt: But as you haue bene vntill novv the example and myrror of the poore ignorant people, to dravve them to the true light of the ſpirite, I doe hope through the grace of God, that nothing shall hinder you to continevve vnto the end on ſo holy a vvorke.</p>
            <p>For the poore ignorant people ſeeing the peace and vnitie, and the promptneſſe and good courage that is in you to receiue the holy doctrine, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned through your holy life and conuerſation to come vnto the knovvledge of Ieſus Chriſt, and conſequently to ſaluation. Foraſmuch then as the Lord doth vnto you dayly ſo much good, or shevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto you ſo much of his grace, shevving vnto you from day to day his maruaylous vvorkes, ſet to ſo your handes in the vvorke of the Lord, ſo long as he giueth you time and life, that you doe not leaue for your children that shall come after you, an euill example of life: but inſtruct them in that holy doctrine that you haue receiued, to the ende they may knovve after your death, that they had fathers and mothers that feared God, and vvell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his vvord, and that they haue not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the goſpell in their mouthe onely, but alſo in their handes. And that they vvere not diſſemblers, but true confeſſors of the name of God.</p>
            <p>Diſpoſe and beſtovve then vvhileſt you haue time ſo vvell your affayres, and buſineſſe according to the meanes as God hath giuen you, that youre ſucceſſors may haue none occaſion to complayne, that you haue left them an euill example: That
<pb facs="tcp:3694:12"/> they ſay not after that you are dead, vve haue had parents &amp; anceſters, vvhich haue had great knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but they feared more to loſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytie and freendship of the vvorlde then of God.</p>
            <p>O hovv much ought you to feare the ſame, for it vvill turne to your great confuſion.</p>
            <p>Remember alſo that vvhich the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> ſaying, if there be any that prouideth not for his ovvne, and namely for them of his houſholde, the ſame denieth the faithe, and is vvorſe then an infidel. Therefore all faithfull people ought to take god heede and marke vvell thoſe vvordes, for it is a great euill to denye the fayth.</p>
            <p>Take good heede you be not an offence to any man, I doe meane in doing euil, be gentle curteous &amp; mercifull the one to the other, not rendring euill for euill,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.</note> but render good for the euill. Liue ſo holy that if men vvold punish &amp; perſecute you, that they doe not punish any thing in you but righteouſnes, and good life. And in that doing you shall declare your ſelues to be the children of God.

Notwithſtanding, leaſt I ſhould be accuſed and condemned of negligence, which I haue ſought to ſhunne and auoyde, I determined priuatly, to ſet thy ſight openly, that this booke hath bene out of the Doctors and Counſelles collected carefully, compoſed by the authour pithilye, and by the ſame alledged fitly and aptlye: and not onely out of the Doctors, but out of the Popes owne Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons culled gratiouſly, whereby he hath not brought a Doctor agaynſt a Pope, but a Pope with a Pope conferred learnedlye. This being rightly wayed and conſidered. I thinke there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for the more enuious (being the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on godly, the matter their owne, the order fitte and conuenient) as an obiect to worke on theyr inſatiable minde, and deſire of reprehenſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they wyll ſeeke and runne to the manners of the author (common practiſes now a dayes) to ſearch and prye ouer curiouſlye, ſomething to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimaduert and oppugne, and ſore agreeued that he hath beaten them with their owne rodde, ſay with

Yet leaſt there ſhoulde growe in their mindes ſome vndeſerued ſuſpition, being the authour vnknowen, I will endeauour not onely to remoue, but to roote it cleane out of their entendement: and playnely affirme that which is credibly and ſincerely referred to me, that he was of manners modeſt, of life laborious, of countenance ſober, and of witte quicke, and willing to profite euery one to his power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3694:79"/> of Abraham, agaynſt thoſe which woulde not do any good, and which preſume them ſelues of fayth: of which Abraham, Saint Paule hath prayſed his fayth, and yet the Apoſtles are not contrarie the one to the other:<note place="margin">S. Paule and S. Iames are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the one to the other.</note> but he ſpeaketh of the work which is knowne to all men (that is to ſaye) that Abraham did offer his ſonne vnto God, for to doe ſacrifice. That is a great worke, but that is of fayth. I doe prayſe the buylding of the worke made vpon the foundation, but I doe beholde the foundation of faith. I doe prayſe the fruite of the good and iuſt worke, but I acknowledge the roote in fayth. For if Abraham did thoſe things without right fayth, nothing woulde haue profited him, whatſoeuer worke it hadde bene. Furthermore, if Abraham did keepe ſo the fayth, that when God commaunded him to offer his ſonne for ſacrifice, hee thought in himſelfe, I will not doe it, and yet neuertheleſſe I doe beleeue that God will deliuer me, although that I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and deſpiſe his commaundements. Fayth without workes ſhoulde be deade, and ſhoulde abyde as a drie roote, barren, and without fruite. What then? we ought
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3694:79"/> not to preferre workes before fayth: that is to ſay, nothing is ſayde to be well done before fayth: although that they are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of men prayſe worthye, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are vayne. And me thinketh that they are like vnto great ſtrengths, and vnto the eaſie courſe out of the waye. Let none then eſteeme his workes. &amp;c.

How am I ſo much aſſured by the ſame, if I doe nothing? yea, I ſhall not bee counted by the ſame to haue truſt in the good fayth, if I doe not worke by loue. O Apoſtle I doe heare thee, wilt thou here prayſe vnto me fayth without workes? But loue is the worke of fayth, which loue cannot be ydle, that it doe forſake all euill, and doe all the good<note place="margin">Loue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ydle, for it forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euil, and doth good.</note> that it can.

After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes he ſayth:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> For we doe well know, that as for eternall life, the afflictions of this lyfe are not worthie of the glorie which ſhall be ſhewed vpon vs, although that one only man doth abide and ſuffer al. For mans merites are not ſuche, that for them eternall life ſhoulde be due of right,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3694:83"/> or that we ſhoulde ſaye that God doth vs wrong, if he doe not giue them vs by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them. For though I ſhoulde holde my peace, that all merites are the gifts of God, inſomuch that for them man is more indebted to God, than God is to man. What is that that all the merites doe in reſpect of ſo great glorie; To conclude what is he that is more excellent than the Prophete, vnto whome the Lorde doth giue ſo excellent a witneſſe, ſaying:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 16.</note> I haue founde a man according to mine owne heart.

Let no man then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue himſelfe, for if he will thinke well, he ſhall finde without all doubt that he can not with ten thouſande men go to meete him whiche commeth agaynſt him wyth xx. thouſande. But theſe things which we haue now ſpoken of, are not yet altogither ſufficient, but wee muſt the rather holde them for a beginning and foundation of fayth. Therefore if thou beleeue that thy ſinnes cannot be put or blotted out but by him agaynſt whome onely thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thou doeſt well. But adde yet one

                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> if thou beleeue that one cannot haue them but by him, it ſufficeth not vntill ſuch time as the ſpirite of fayth doth witneſſe that thou haſt them through him:<note place="margin">Let vs aſſure our ſelues to come to hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen through the gift of God.</note> Euen ſo it is neceſſarie that thou haue alſo witneſſe, to wete, that thou doeſt come therevnto tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe Gods liberalitie. For it is he which pardoneth ſinnes, which giueth merites: and yet neuertheleſſe doth giue agayne the rewarde. For all his teſtimonies are moſt aſſured. For as to the remiſſion of ſinnes, I doe hold the paſſion of our Lord for a moſt ſtrong argument. For the crye of his bloude hath had greater force than the bloude of Abel:<note place="margin">

Behold the preſumption of the infidelles, which doe ſuch thinges, and are without ſhame, of whiche, firſte they haue imagined euilles and diſceyt againſt vs. And vnto this preſent time they accuſe vs that we flee from them, being ready to kill vs. But whiche is more they doe ſighe and mourne moſt bitterly, bicauſe they cannot altogither deſtroy vs. And doe rebuke vs bicauſe that we feare: And when they murmure of the thing, the more doe they cauſe the euil to returne vpon them ſelues. For if it be euill done to flee, to perſecute is a great deale worſe. For the one hideth himſelfe, to the ende he turne not &amp; change his opinion, &amp; the other perſecuteth for to kill. But it is commaunded to flie, and he that demaundeth to kill tranſgreſſeth the lawe, and giueth vnto vs greater occaſion to flie. Then if the perſecutors doe rebuke vs bicauſe that we doe flee, let them rather be aſhamed in them ſelues, and let them ceaſe and leaue of to lye in wayte, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently thoſe whiche did flie will flie no more: but they will not ceaſe from their

                  <p>For none did euer flee from the meeke and gentle, but rather from the cruell and deceytfull: euerye man that ſighed and which was vexed of Saule, went for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge vnto Dauid, and fled from Saule: But therefore theſe here deſire to put to death thoſe that are hidde, fearing that their malice ſhoulde not be by them ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
